/**
 * just like useQuery, but only runs when user is authorized
 * plus, have couple extra option for more granular cache control
 *
 * default options are "safe", so its just gonna work correctly,
 * but if specific hook wants more granular control, then its that hook responsibility to understand the implications
 * e.g. useBalance with account=all does not need to be refetched when account is being switched,
 * but useBalance with account=123 does need to be refetched when account is being switched,
 *
 * unfortunatelly, there is missing bit of context/state - loginid, as normally its "hidden" in the connection,
 * its not a part of payload, thus, the standard "getKeys()" is just not enough, needs to add extra keys to handle user changing and switching
 *
 * @param name
 * @param payload
 * @param options
 * @param refreshOnAccountSwitch
 * @param refreshOnAccountAdded
 * @returns
