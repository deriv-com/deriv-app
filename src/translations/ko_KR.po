For these execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow."

Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When the client invests in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio that the client has set for the client's account. If the price movement is in the client's favour, returns generated are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against the client's favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client's invested capital."

msgid "In classic Silicon Valley style, Hong Kong based hedge fund manager and entrepreneur, Jean-Yves Sireau, starts Regent Markets in his Hong Kong bedroom. He develops the systems, methods and algorithms for implementing a fixed-odds financial betting system.

Until his innovation, binary options are normally only traded in large quantities."

msgid "In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the Client's Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a 'backstop' in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the Client's maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the Client's CFD account. Therefore, the Client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the Client's CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the Client."

When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client's trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client's account."
