A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。"
