The rationale behind this strategy lies in statistical probabilities, with adjustments to stake sizes based on the perceived likelihood of success. There is a higher likelihood of success in the second trade after one successful trade. Hence the stake adjusts to 3 in the second trade. In the third trade, the stake adjusts to 2 units due to a lower probability of a successful trade. If the third trade is also successful, the strategy then allocates all the previous gains (a total of 6 units of initial stake) into the fourth trade with the aim of doubling the potential profits. If the fourth trade results in a positive outcome, the strategy helps achieve a total gain of 12 units. However, it is crucial to exercise caution, as the risk can escalate quickly with this strategy, and any loss in the fourth trade forfeits all previous gains.","453175851":"Your MT5 Financial STP account will be opened through {{legal_entity_name}}.
