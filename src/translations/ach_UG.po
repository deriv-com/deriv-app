msgid "Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When the client invests in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio that the client has set for the client's account. If the price movement is in the client's favour, returns generated are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against the client's favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client's invested capital."

In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the Client's Account Balance to fall below zero.

Negative Balance Protection provides a 'backstop' in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the Client's maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the Client's CFD account. Therefore, the Client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the Client's CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the Client."
